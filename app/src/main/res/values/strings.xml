        Wayne is a detective. He has been trying to catch a famous serial killer called Sphiggo. Sphiggo is obsessed with Sphynx, a mythical creature with the head of human and body of a lion. The legend says that Sphynx gave people riddles and the one that wouldn\'t know the answer would be strangled. Sphiggo is doing the same thing to his victims with the help of his companions and poisonous gas. He puts them in a room with a logic task. If they pass the first one they go to the next one. There are 10 challenges. If they can pass the challenges they can leave, but if not he kills them with gas. No one has beaten the challenge.

Wayne immediately realized that he is in one of Sphiggo\'s traps. Sphiggos said that if he beat him he can leave and Sphiggo will give himself to the hand of the law.
